      <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>
      <p>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
      <p>
        Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.</p>

    <article>
      <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>
      <p>Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:</p>
      <p>Python is a general-purpose, versatile and popular programming language. It’s great as a first language because it is concise and easy to read, and it is also a good language to have in any programmer’s stack as it can be used for everything from web development to software development and scientific applications.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
        </li>
        <li>Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
        <li>
          Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
        </li>
        <li>Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li>
        <li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li>
        <li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li>
        <li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
        <li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li>

      <p>Just to give you a little excitement about Python, I'm going to give you a small conventional Python Hello World program:</p>

      As mentioned before, Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
      <li>Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li>
      <li>A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
      <li>Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</li>
      <li>Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</li>
      <li>Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li>
      <li>Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li>
      <li>GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</li>
      <li>Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</li>
    </ul>

    <header>Python Indentation</header>
    <article>
     
      <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.<p>
      <code>if 5 > 2:
         &emsp; &emsp; print("Five is greater than two!")</code>
      <p>Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:</p>
      <code>if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Python_Variables">
    <header>Python Variables</header>
    <article>
     
      <p>In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
      </p>
      <code>x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"</code>
      Python has no command for declaring a variable.

    <header>Comments</header>
    <article> 
     
      <p>Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

        Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:</p>
      <code>#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")</code>
